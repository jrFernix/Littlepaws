				<h4>About Hannah</h4>
				<p>Nem is a very loving girl who is well mannered and quiet. She lives to quietly follow you around and would make an excellent companion.</p>
				
				<p>She is great with:
					<br>People likes children and elderly.
					<br>She has so far ignored cats.</p>
				
				<p>She is not great with dogs smaller than her - she can be a little possessive of her owner and can get jealous. She has been very good when walking with other dogs and out and about.</p>

We expect you to have a complete understanding of the condition and discuss the potential surgical, environmental and medical modifications you may have to do for this condition with your vet.</p>
				
				<p>She is very healthy and has passed all of his vet checks. She has not had airway surgery as she breathes very well but this is something that may need to be done in the future.</p>
